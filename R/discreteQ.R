#' Uniform inference on quantile and quantile effect functions for discrete outcomes
#'
#' The function \code{discreteQ} provides uniform confidence bands for the unconditional
#' quantile function, the quantile treatment effect function or the
#' decomposition of the observed difference between the quantile function of an
#' outcome for two groups. This function implements the algorithms suggested in Chernozhukov et al. (2019).
#' See also the vignette available with \code{vignette("discreteQ", package="discreteQ")}.
#'
#' The function \code{discreteQ} can be used in three different ways:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item
#' First, if no treatment variable is specified in the argument \code{d}, then the the
#' command will provide uniform bands for the unconditional quantile and distribution functions of
#' \code{y}.
#' \item
#' Second, if a treatment variable is specified in the argument \code{d} but
#' \code{decomposition=FALSE}, then the command will provide uniform bands that
#' cover the quantile and distribution functions of the treated and control outcomes and the
#' quantile treatment effect function (the difference between both quantile functions).
#' \item Third, if a treatment variable is
#' specified in the argument \code{d} and \code{decomposition=TRUE}, then the command provides
#' uniform bands that cover both distribution functions, both quantile functions as well as the
#' decomposition of their difference into an explained (by the regressors
#' \code{x}) and unexplained component.
#' }
#'
#' The output of the function is a long list of step functions (see below for the details). We recommend to use
#' the \code{\link{plot.discreteQ}} and \code{\link{summary.discreteQ}}
#' functions to analyze the results. For further details see the vignette available with \code{vignette("discreteQ", package="discreteQ")}.
#'
#' @param y outcome (vector of length n).
#' @param d treatment or group variable (binary vector of length n).
#' @param x matrix of regressors (n x p matrix). \code{x} must include a constant if appropriate (i.e. the constant is NOT added automatically). The function \code{\link[stats]{model.matrix}} can be used to create the matrix \code{x} if factor variables or interaction terms are present.
#' @param w sampling weights (vector of length n).
#' @param decomposition logical, indicating if the decomposition of the observed
#'   difference between the control and treated quantile functions should be
#'   performed. By default, inference about the quantile treatment effect
#'   function is performed.
#' @param q.range vector of length 2 that provides the lowest and highest
#'   quantile indexes. The uniform bands will cover the whole QF and QE
#'   function in this range. Default is c(0.05,0.95).
#' @param method link function for the distribution regression model. Possible
#'   values: "logit" (the default), "probit", "cloglog", "lpm" (linear
#'   probability model, i.e. OLS estimation of binary regressions), "cauchit", "drp" (incomplete gamma link function suggested in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, Melly and WÃ¼trich (2019). The maximum likelihood estimator of the fully parametric Poisson regression model is used if \code{method = "poisson"}.
#'   This argument is relevant only if there are regressors in \code{x}.
#' @param bsrep number of bootstrap replications. Default: 200.
#' @param alpha confidence level. Default: 0.05.
#' @param ys specifies the thresholds at which the cumulative distribution
#'   function will be estimated. This argument can be specified either as a
#'   scalar that will be interpreted as the number of thresholds or as a vector
#'   that will contain the values of the thresholds. By default, the cdf is
#'   estimated at all distinct observed values of the outcome in the sample if
#'   there are less than 100 unique values and at the 99 empirical percentiles
#'   of the outcomes if there are more than 100 distinct values.
#' @param cl a cluster object as returned by the function \code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}}. Parallel computing is
#'   not used if this argument is not specified.
#' @param cluster vector that specifies to which group each observation belongs.
#'   The cluster weighted bootstrap is used if this argument is specified. Otherwise,
#'   simple random sampling is assumed.
#' @param old.res a discreteQ object (obtained with the argument return.boot set
#'   to TRUE). This argument allows for instance to change the size \code{alpha} or the quantile range \code{q.range}
#'   without recomputing the estimates.
#' @param return.boot logical scalar. The results of the bootstrap are return in
#'   the matrix F.b when this argument is set to TRUE.
#' @param list_of_seeds list of seeds for L'Ecuyer RNG. The length of this list
#'   must be the same as the value of the argument \code{bsrep}.
#' @param return.seeds logical scalar. The list of seeds is returned by the
#'   function if this argument is set to TRUE.
#' @param estim.glm function used to estimate the binary regressions if \code{method} is "logit", "probit", "cloglog" or "cauchit". The default is the function fastglm() from the package fastglm. Tested alternatives: glm.fit, glm2::glm.fit2, speedglm::speedglm.wfit.
#' @param par.estim arguments to be passed to the function selected by \code{estim.glm}. For instance, the arguments \code{method}, \code{tol} and \code{maxit} of \code{fastglm} can be set.
#' @return \code{discreteQ} returns an object of \code{\link{class}} "\code{discreteQ}". There are methods available for plotting ("\code{plot}", see
#'   \code{\link{plot.discreteQ}}) and summarizing ("\code{summary}", see
#'   \code{\link{summary.discreteQ}}) "\code{discreteQ}" objects. We recommend
#'   using them to analyze the results.
#'
