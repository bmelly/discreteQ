Datasets and codes for "Generic Inference on Quantile and Quantile Effect Functions for Discrete Outcomes"
# These codes and datasets produce the figures of the paper "Generic Inference on Quantile and Quantile Effect Functions for Discrete Outcomes" written by V. Chernozhukov, I. Fernandez-Val, B. Melly, and K. Wuethrich. This paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05142.
# The first empirical example uses data from the Oregon health experiment. The data are available at http://www.nber.org/oregon/4.data.html.
# The second empirical example is a decomposition of the black-white testscore gap. The data are available at dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.2.981.
