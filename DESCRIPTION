Description: The package discreteQ implements the procedures developed and applied
    in the research paper "Generic inferenc on quantile and quantile effect 
    functions
    for discrete outcomes" written by Victor Chernozhukov, Ivan Fernandez-Val,
    Blaise Melly and Kaspar Wüthrich. The command provides uniform bands for three 
    different cases: (i) for the unconditional quantile function of an outcome 
    variable, it
    implements the algorithm defined in Appendix B of the paper;
    (ii) for the quantile treatment effect of a binary treatment variable, it 
    implements the algorithm used in the first application (Section 4.3);
    (iii) for the decomposition of the difference between the quantile functions
    of two groups, it implements the algorithm used in the second application
    (Section 4.4). All procedures are valid for discrete, continuous and
    mixed dicrete-continuous outcomes. See the paper for the precise definition 
    of the estimators and their statistical properties.
